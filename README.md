CODE 1

A function, parallel(), that, when called, outputs the effective resistance of a network of 2 or more resistors connected in parallel. 
The function is be able to accept a list of numbers of any length. I did it originallyu in a way where the user could enter the reisistance values manually then removed it since it was not what the question asked for.

Parameters:number of resistors, value of resistors, total reisitanc

Output: Effective resistance in circuit 


CODE 2 
A function, `potential_divider()`, that takes two values as argument, a number that represents a voltage supply value and a list of numbers that represent resistance values of resistors connected in series. The function prints the voltage drop across each resistor in a list. The function is be able to accept a list of numbers of any length.

Parameters: number of resistors, value of resistors, voltage value, total resistance 
Output: Resistor values and their coressponding voltage drop

CODE 3  
A function temperature_check(), that accepts a single number, a patient's body temperature, and a single character, the unit of temperature. The function prints the output thst shows that the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the number passed to the function.

Reason for Code 

If I dont do it, I'll get a 0
