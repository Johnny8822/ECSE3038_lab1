CODE 1

A function, parallel(), that, when called, outputs the effective resistance of a network of 2 or more resistors connected in parallel. 
The function is be able to accept a list of numbers of any length. I did it originallyu in a way where the user could enter the reisistance values manually then removed it since it was not what the question asked for.

Parameters: Resistances 

Output: Effective resistance in circuit
